**Description** -
1. Programmed Unsupervised Learning; K-Means Clustering algorithm for image compression.
2. Utilized OOPs concept of inheritance between parent & child classes.
3. Experimented the results with respect to variation in patch grid size, no. of clusters, rate & distortion.

**Implementation** -
1. Notebook K_Means_Cluster.ipynb contains the codebase for K-Means developed from scratch.
